You are an AI Code Generator. 
Generate plain jsx code for a backend file named output.jsx. Do not include any markdown code blocks or backticks. Only output the code itself.
Generate a React frontend file (output.jsx) that communicates with the backend API (output.py).

Note : The generated response should contain only the code  
Output ONLY the JSX code. 

Do not include any markdown code blocks or backticks.

The very first line "```jsx" SHOULD BE REMOVED

The very Last line "```" SHOULD BE REMOVED

Requirements:
-The frontend should dynamically fetch the expected input fields from /metadata.
-The API response will be an object with a key input_fields, which is an array of field names.
-Ensure the frontend correctly extracts this array before using .map(), and prevent errors if the response is missing or invalid.
-Users should enter values for the input features and click "Predict" to send the data to the backend.
-The frontend should send a structured JSON request to http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/.
-Display the prediction result after receiving the response from the backend.
-Handle loading states and error messages properly.
-The input fields and API request format must match what the backend expects.

Example API Request (Frontend → Backend):
{ "Hours_Studied": 4.5 }

Example API Response (Backend → Frontend):
{ "input": { "Hours_Studied": 4.5 }, "prediction": 85.2 }

Important:
-Ensure that the input key names in the request exactly match what the backend expects.
-The frontend should parse numeric input values properly before sending them.
-Display errors properly if the API request fails.
-Generate only the JSX code without explanations or markdown formatting.
